------TODO, ponderings, phrases to incorporate, etc.------
- "definition" of 'medical device': paper006-04 and paper101-09 mentions FDA/US

- look for recent statistics on IoT-based attacks and what organisations are doing to protect themselves;
   - paper002-02.pdf discusses in introduction (revisit those numbers)
- paper002-02 claimed that 'usual' RA frameworks do not 'cope' with IoT (thus justifying the 'creation' of a new one that is tailored for IoT): is that so? why? which situations it woudln't be possible to apply?
         --> See Nurse's paper about this discussion <--
   - most of the RA currently employed are 'generic' enough to be able to 'adapt' to a myriad of circumstances posed by modern infrastructure, and IoT belong to this class;
- paper006-04 mentions the transmission of sensitive data such as Patient Health Information (PHI) - perhaps we should also mention Electronic Health Records (EHR) - 
- need to 'compartmentalise' security analysis by inspecting the components/divisions/organisation of IoMT and see where threat actors may have opportunities to abuse systems and networks
- relating to paper010-05.pdf, that focuses on 'critical systems', aamof, healthcare is considered a critical infrastructure (according to the UK) - check this out and complement in the paper
- as a bunch of papers mention the IoT market size and future predictions, perhaps a sub-section detailing this would be interesting, determining the *real* size and estimations for discussion
- brief 'terminology' or 'taxonomy' paragraph, stating all IoT, IoMT, MIoT, e-health (as discovered in previous SLR phases)

- heterogeinity as a security measure (paper011-06.pdf discusses that 'thehre are no consensus or agreed-upon standards, increasing complixy and preventing a unified secure scheme pertaining the entire MIoT ecosystem)
   - I would need to find a discussion where this 'is a feature', not an issue

- Healthcare systems: Electronic Medical Recording (EMR), Order Communication Systems (OCS), Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS) - from paper017-07.pdf

- Mention: 
   - Body Area Network (BAN)
   - Implantable Medical Devices (IMD)
   - Implantable and Wearable Medical Devices (IWMD)
   - Implantable Cardiac Defibrillator (ICD)

paper006-04-04: IoMT
1. IoT-based vulnerabilities: prevent healthcare service unavailability or disruption; mentions several 'procurement' guidelines specific to healthcare (FDA, MDS2, EU MDR) to sustain security and privacy requirements; i) authentication, ii) trust, iii) data integrity and confidentiality, trusted execution, iv) prevention of malicious alterations, v) protections against DoS.
2. Risk: mentions "medical risk" (according to FDA/US) in three classes: Class I (lowest risk), Class II, and Class III;
3. Risk Assessment: generic risk models (NIST and ISO); Threat Modelling for IoMT (STRIDE, DREAD, attack trees and Multiple-Valued Logic); Section IV compares RA standards and best practices for IoMT (Fig 3 is very nice); comments on ISO, NIST, UL standards, OWASP, MAYO Clinic, ENISA, AAMI, TGA, MITRE; discusses security controls for IoMT;
4. Methods of risk: discusses current standards, recommendations and guidelines for risk;
5. Case studies: generic (for all IoMT) - see Figure 2, very interesting Generic Risk Model for IoMT (note: looks very inspired on NIST's terminology, eg, predisposing conditions, adverse impact, etc.); This generic model invites analysts to do a thorough 'security assessment': threat assessment, vulnerability assessment, impact assessment, risk mitigation or risk treatment;
Observations: 
"definition" of 'medical device' (according to US Food Drug & Cosmetic Act): instrument intented for use in the 'diagnostics, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease'. Interconnected medical devices perform generation, collection, analysis and transmission of patient medical data through healthcare provider networks (cloud or internal servers).
"classification" of medical devices: physiologic monitoring (wearable), medical treatment (implantable medical devices - IMD), in-hospital connected (institutional medical devices or Surgical Robotics), and ambient (assisting treatment, patient identification, movement detection, sensing);
 
phrases and keywords: used Google to retrieve stardards and grey literature associated to the subject;
It has a somewhat 'controversial' statement right on the abstract to motivate/justify the need for specific RA into IoMT: "Traditional risk assessment methodologies, however, cannot be effectively applied in the IoMT context since IoMT devices form part of a distributed and trustless environment and naturally support functionalities that favor reliability and usability instead of security."

phrases and keywords: 
Somewhat 'controversial' phrase: "Although security attacks against cyber-physical systems [17] and IoT devices [13] have received considerable attention during the last years, the significance of IoT-enabled attacks is not always fully assessed."
   - 'significance' of IoT is not fully assessed: how and why?

paper163-15-11: IoT
1. IoT-based vulnerabilities: 
2. Risk: 
3. Risk Assessment: describes "core risk assessment concepts": generally understood as the process of identifying, estimating and prioritising risks to organisational assets and operations (NIST SP 800-30Rev-1, 2012)
Describes usual approaches: NIST SP 800-30, ISO/IEC 27001, OCTAVE, CCTA Risk Analysis and Mgmt Method (CRAMM), EBIOS;
Discusses particularities related to "IoT dynamics": variability of scale in devices and systems; dynamism and temporality of connections between devices; heterogeneity of actors interacting with IoT ecosystems;
Discussion on "where current risk assessment methods fail": i) shortcomings of periodic assessments (triggered by organisational's prior risk assessment that may no longer be valid), such triggers include changes in the system, business processes or threat intelligence
Interesting phrase: "The reason why risk assessment approaches are inadequate for the IoT is that their periodic assessment nature, which is already a notable weakness is exacerbated due to the IoT dynamics we've outlined. For instance, the variability in scale of IoT systems means that the probability of a new system emerging between periodic assessments will be high. To be effective, risk assessment would need to be able to predict and consider the possible systems that might emerge prior to the next assessment. This is extremely challenging, and current approaches typically do not mandate it."
And another: "Risk assessment is currently focused on determining risk for systems that exist, and even now, there are challenges in developing a comprehensive understanding of such systems’ environments. 5 As noted, this is unlikely to be sufficient for the IoT because systems could well change shape more quickly than such periodic assessments can account for."
--->> Table 1 outlines why current risk assessment approaches are inadequate for the IoT <<---
And finally, in "the need for new approaches" subsection: "We therefore anticipate the need for automated and continuous risk assessment approaches as well as the development of new support tools to assist with simulation and modeling that can enhance our predictive powers."

4. Methods of risk: 
5. Case studies: 
Observations: 

phrases and keywords: 
"Internet of Things (IoT) is set to benefit society through a range of smart platforms and a pervasive coupling of digital, cyber-physical, and social systems."
"From a security and trust management perspective, however, the challenge with the IoT is that existing risk assessment methodologies were established prior to its development."
