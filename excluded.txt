Steps:
1. Retrieve all titles and abstracts for the search query, except the ones 'removed before screening' (for any reason);
   - total: 180
   - removed before screening: 
      -> 6 (Scholar - not research, repeated)
      -> 2 (ACM-DL - tech report, expression of concern)
      -> 2 (IEEExplore - magazine article)
   - now total = 170
2. For all records, see title/abstract to see if it aligns with research question
   - total: 170
   - records excluded:
      -> X (Scholar - why?)
      -> Y (ACM-DL - why?)
      -> Z (IEEExplore - why?)
3. Look now for 'reports', ie, papers, and see if you can fetch them
   - total: 160 (?)
   - reports not retrieved
      -> X (Scholar - why?)
      -> Y (ACM-DL - why?)
      -> Z (IEEExplore - why?)
4. Reports assessed for eligibility - now you go through the paper in its entirety
   - total: 100 (?)
   - reports excluded
      -> X (Scholar - why?)
      -> Y (ACM-DL - why?)
      -> Z (IEEExplore - why?)
5. Now, you'll know:
   - Reports of included studies (n = ?)
